## Abstract

This standard is an extension of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md). It proposes an additional role (`user`) which can be granted to addresses, and a time where the role is automatically revoked (`expires`). The `user` role represents permission to "use" the NFT, but not be able to transfer it or set operators.

## Motivation

Some NFTs have certain utilities. For example: in-game NFTs can be "used" to play, virtual land can be "used" to build scenes, and music NFTs can be "used" while listening. In some cases, the owner and user may not be the same account. Someone may purchase an NFT with utility, but they may not have time or ability to use it, so separating the "use" right from ownership makes a lot of sense.

Nowadays, many NFTs are managed by adding the role of **controller/operator**. Accounts in these roles can perform specific usage actions but canâ€™t approve or transfer the NFT like an owner. If an owner plans to set someone as **controller/operator** for a certain period of time, owner needs to submit two on-chain transactions, at the start time and the end time.

It is conceivable that with the further expansion of NFT application, the problem of usage rights management will become more common, so it is necessary to establish a unified standard to facilitate collaboration among all applications.

By adding **user**, it enables multiple protocols to integrate and build on top of usage rights, while **expires** facilitates automatic ending of each usage without second transaction on chain.

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

```solidity
interface IERC4907 {

    // Logged when the user of a NFT is changed or expires is changed
    /// @notice Emitted when the `user` of an NFT or the `expires` of the `user` is changed
    /// The zero address for user indicates that there is no user address
    event UpdateUser(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed user, uint64 expires);

    /// @notice set the user and expires of a NFT
    /// @dev The zero address indicates there is no user
    /// Throws if `tokenId` is not valid NFT
    /// @param user  The new user of the NFT
    /// @param expires  UNIX timestamp, The new user could use the NFT before expires
    function setUser(uint256 tokenId, address user, uint64 expires) external;

    /// @notice Get the user address of an NFT
    /// @dev The zero address indicates that there is no user or the user is expired
    /// @param tokenId The NFT to get the user address for
    /// @return The user address for this NFT
    function userOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns(address);

    /// @notice Get the user expires of an NFT
    /// @dev The zero value indicates that there is no user
    /// @param tokenId The NFT to get the user expires for
    /// @return The user expires for this NFT
    function userExpires(uint256 tokenId) external view returns(uint256);
}
```

The `userOf(uint256 tokenId)` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view`.

The `userExpires(uint256 tokenId)` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view`.

The `setUser(uint256 tokenId, address user, uint64 expires)` function MAY be implemented as `public` or `external`.

The `UpdateUser` event MUST be emitted when a user address is changed or the user expires is changed.

The `supportsInterface` method MUST return `true` when called with `0xad092b5c`.

## Rationale

Many developers are trying to develop based on the NFT utility, and some of them have added roles already,  but there are some key problems need to be solved. The advantages of this standard are below.

### Clear Permissions Management

Usage rights are part of ownership, so **owner** can modify **user** at any time, while **user** is only granted some specific permissions, such as **user** usually does not have permission to make permanent changes to NFT's Metadata.

NFTs may be used in multiple applications, and adding the user role to NFTs makes it easier for the application to make special grants of rights.

### Simple On-chain Time Management

Most NFTs do not take into account the expiration time even though the role of the user is added, resulting in the need for the owner to manually submit on-chain transaction to cancel the user rights, which does not allow accurate on-chain management of the use time and will waste gas.

The usage right often corresponds to a specific time, such as deploying scenes on land, renting game props,  etc. Therefore, it can reduce the on-chain transactions and save gas with **expires**.

### Easy Third-Party Integration

The standard makes it easier for third-party protocols to manage NFT usage rights without permission from the NFT issuer or the NFT application.

## Backwards Compatibility

As mentioned in the specifications section, this standard can be fully ERC721 compatible by adding an extension function set.

In addition, new functions introduced in this standard have many similarities with the existing functions in ERC721. This allows developers to easily adopt the standard quickly.

## Test Cases

### Test Contract

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./ERC4907.sol";

contract ERC4907Demo is ERC4907 {

    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol)
     ERC4907(name,symbol)
     {         
     }

    function mint(uint256 tokenId, address to) public {
        _mint(to, tokenId);
    }

}
```

### Test Code
```
truffle develop
nft = await ERC4907Demo.new("ERC4907Demo","ERC4907Demo")
nft.mint(1,accounts[0])
nft.ownerOf(1)
nft.userOf(1)
nft.setUser(1,accounts[1],10203038769)
nft.userOf(1)
```

    function userOf(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual returns(address){
        if( uint256(_users[tokenId].expires) >=  block.timestamp){
            return  _users[tokenId].user;
        }
        else{
            return address(0);
        }
    }

    /// @param tokenId The NFT to get the user expires for
    /// @return The user expires for this NFT
    function userExpires(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual returns(uint256){
        return _users[tokenId].expires;
    }

    /// @dev See {IERC165-supportsInterface}.
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override returns (bool) {
        return interfaceId == type(IERC4907).interfaceId || super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }

    function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId
    ) internal virtual override{
        super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId);

        if (from != to) {
            _users[tokenId].user = address(0);
            _users[tokenId].expires = 0;
            emit UpdateUser(tokenId, address(0), 0);
        }
    }
} 
```

## Security Considerations

This EIP standard can completely protect the rights of the owner, the owner can change the NFT user and expires at any time.
