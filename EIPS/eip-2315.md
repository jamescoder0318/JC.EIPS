## Abstract

This proposal provides a _complete_, _safe_ and _efficient_ control-flow facility.

It deprecates `JUMP` and `JUMPI`.

It introduces two opcodes to support simple subroutines:
* `RJUMPSUB destination`— call a subroutine
* `RETURNSUB` — return from call

It depends on the two opcodes proposed by [EIP-4200](./eip-4200.md):
* `RJUMP destination` — relative jump
* `RJUMPI destination` — conditional relative jump

In concert with [EIP-3540](./eip-4200.md) and [EIP-3670](./eip-3670.md) it ensures that valid code will not execute invalid instructions, jump to invalid locations, or underflow stack. It will maintain consistent numbers of inputs and outputs for subroutines, and ensure that stack height is bounded in the absence of recursion.

We believe this to be one of the simplest possible proposals that meets these requirements

## Motivation

### We want a complete control-flow facility.

Jumps, conditional jumps and subroutines were proposed by Alan Turing in 1945 as a means of organizing the logic of the code and the design of the memory crystals for his Automatic Computing Engine:
> "We wish to be able to arrange that sequences of orders can divide at various points, continuing in different ways according to the outcome of the calculations to date...  We also wish to be able to arrange for the splitting up of operations into subsidiary operations... To start on a subsidiary operation we need only make a note of where we left off the major operation and then apply the first instruction of the subsidiary.  When the subsidiary is over we look up the note and continue with the major operation."
> 
> — Alan Turing — *cf. B.E. Carpenter, R.W. Doran, "The other Turing machine." The Computer Journal, Volume 20, Issue 3, January 1977.*

In more contemporary terms, we have sequences of instructions, jumps and conditional jumps that divide sequences into blocks, subroutine calls, and a stack of addresses to return to.  The details vary, but similar facilities have proven their value across a long line of machines going back over 75 years.

Unlike these machines, the Ethereum Virtual Machine _does not_ provide subroutine operations.  Instead, they must be synthesized using the dynamic `JUMP` instruction, which takes its destination on the stack. Further, the EVM provides _only_ dynamic jumps, preventing the static analysis we need.

### We want a safer control-flow facilty.

The EVM has unusually high requirements for safety.  Not only do many smart contracts control inordinately large amounts of valuable Ether, but once placed on the blockchain any defects are visible to attackers and cannot be repaired.  We propose here to statically validate, at initialization time, that code will not execute invalid instructions, jump to invalid locations, or underflow stack.  It will maintain consistent numbers of inputs and outputs for subroutines, and stack growth is bounded in the absence of recursion.

### We want an efficient control-flow facility.

The presence of dynamic jumps and lack of subroutines and static jumps causes two major ineffiencies. First, the need to synthesize static jumps and subroutines with dynamic jumps wastes space and gas and causes needless complexity, as we will show below. 

Worse, dynamic jumps can branch to any destination in the code, so quadratic "path explosions" are possible when traversing the flow of control. For Ethereum, this is a denial-of-service vulnerability that prevents us, at initialization time, from validating the safe use of EVM code and from compiling EVM code to machine code.

## Specification

### Opcodes

#### `RJUMPSUB (0x5f) destination: uint16`

Transfers control to a subroutine.
1. Decode the `destination` from the immediate data at `PC`.
2. Push the current `PC + 3` to the `return stack`.
3. Set `PC` to `destination`.

The gas cost is _low_.

#### `RETURNSUB (0x5e)`

Returns control to the caller of a subroutine.
1. Pop the `return stack` to `PC`.

The destination address is relative to the current PC. The address is encoded as a two-byte, twos-complement signed integer, stored MSB-first.

The gas cost is _verylow_.

_Notes:_
* _Values popped off the `return stack` do not need to be validated, since they are alterable only by `RJUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB`._ 
* _The description above lays out the semantics of these instructions in terms of a `return stack`.  But the actual state of the `return stack` is not observable by EVM code or consensus-critical to the protocol.  (For example, a node implementer may code `RJUMPSUB` to unobservably push `PC` on the `return stack` rather than `PC + 1`, which is allowed so long as `RETURNSUB` observably returns control to the `PC + 3` location.)_

### Validity

If the execution of an instruction would violate a condition, then the execution is in an exceptional halting state. The Yellow Paper defines five such states.
1. Insufficient gas
2. More than 1024 stack items
3. Insufficient stack items
4. Invalid jump destination
5. Invalid instruction

We would like to consider EVM code valid iff no execution of the program can lead to an exceptional halting state.  In practice, we must test at runtime for conditions 1 and 2 — sufficient gas and sufficient stack.  We don’t know how much gas there will be, we don’t know how deep a recursion may go, and analysis of stack depth even for non-recursive programs is nontrivial.  All of the remaining conditions MUST be validated statically, in time and space quasi-linear in the size of the code.

#### Constraints on Valid Code

* Every instruction MUST be valid.
   * The `JUMP` and `JUMPI` instructions ARE NOT valid.
* Every jump MUST be valid:
   * The `RJUMP`, `RJUMPI`, or `RJUMPSUB` instructions MUST NOT address immediate data or addresses outside of their code section.
* The stacks MUST always be valid:
   * The number of items on the `data stack` MUST always be positive.
   * The number of items on the `return stack`MUST always be positive.
* The data stack MUST be consistently aligned:
   * The absolute difference between the current `stack pointer` and the `stack pointer` on entry to the current subroutine MUST be the same for each _execution_ of a _byte_code_.

## Rationale

This is a purely semantic specification, placing no constraints on the syntax of code sections beyond being a sequence of opcodes and immediate data.  It only promises that valid code will not, as it were, jam up the gears of the machine.

By avoiding syntactic constraints we allow for optimizations like tail call elimination, moving cold code out of line, sharing stack with called subroutines, and others.

### Validation

Rather than enforce constraints via syntax, we enforce them via validation.

The constraints on valid code are
* all of the exceptional halting states that we can validate,
* the minimal constraints required to ensure that code can be validated and compiled in time and space quasi-linear in the size of the code, following each edge only once.

The `RJUMP`, `RJUMPI` and `RJUMPSUB` instructions take their destination as an immediate argument, which cannot change at runtime.  Having constant destinations for all jumps means that all jump destinations can be validated at initialization time, not runtime.  Dynamic jumps can branch to any destination in the code, so exploitable quadratic "path explosions" are possible when traversing the control flow graph, as is done when validating or compiling code. Deprecating `JUMP` and `JUMPI` prevents this.

Requiring a consistently aligned`data stack` also
* prevents stack underflow,
* ensures that all calls to a subroutine have the same number of inputs and the same number of outputs,
* ensures that stack height is bounded, (in the absence of recursion) and
* ensures that code validation and compilation algorithms that traverse the control-flow graph can break cycles at joins, which allows us to implement streaming, one-pass, and other quasi-linear compilers.

_Note: The JVM and Wasm enforce similar constraints on the stack for similar reasons._

### Alternative Designs

There are a few major designs for a subroutine facility, two of which are considered here.  The others are mostly not appropriate for the EVM, such as self-modifying code that writes return addresses into called subroutines.

*1. Keep return addresses on a dedicated return stack.* Turing's design is often used by stack machines, including those for Forth, Java, Wasm, and others.  The data stack is used almost entirely for computation, with a dedicated stack for return addresses.  A single instruction suffices to call, and another to return from a routine.

*2. Keep return addresses on the data stack.*  This design is often used by register machines, including CDC, IBM, DEC, Intel, and ARM.  The registers are used primarily for computation, and the stack maintains call frames for return addresses, arguments, and local variables.  On the EVM there are no registers for computation, so using the stack for both purposes can be less than ideal.

#### We prefer the dedicated return stack.

* It maintains a clear separation between calculation and flow of control:
  * the data stack is free of vulnerable return addresses and
  * it's impossible to overwrite the return stack.
* It improves efficiency:
  * it uses native arithmetic rather than 256-bit EVM instructions for the return address,
  * doesn't use up a `data stack` slot for the return address and
  * needs less motion of 256-bit data on the stack.

### Efficiency

We illustrate here how subroutine instructions can be used to reduce the complexity and gas costs of both ordinary and optimized subroutine calls compared to using `JUMP`.

#### **Simple Subroutine Call**

Consider these examples of a fairly minimal subroutine, including the code to call it.

Subroutine call, using `RJUMPSUB`:
```
CALL_SQUARE:
    push 0x02       ; 3 gas
    rjumpsub SQUARE ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas

SQUARE:
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas
```
_Total gas: 22_

Subroutine call, using `JUMP`:
```
CALL_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    push 0x02       ; 3 gas
    push RTN_SQUARE ; 3 gas
    push SQUARE     ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas
RTN_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas

SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas
```
_Total: 50 gas_.

Using `RJUMPSUB` versus `JUMP` saves _50 - 22 = 28 gas_ — a _56%_ improvement.

#### **Tail Call Optimization**

Of course in cases like this one we can optimize the tail call, so that the return from `SQUARE` actually returns from `TEST_SQUARE`.

Tail call optimization, using `RJUMPSUB` and `RETURNSUB`:
```
CALL_SQUARE:
    push 0x02       ; 3 gas
    rjump SQUARE    ; 3 gas

SQUARE:
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    returnsub       ; 3 gas
```
_Total: 17 gas_


Tail call optimization, using `JUMP`:
```
CALL_SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    push 0x02       ; 3 gas
    SQUARE          ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas

SQUARE:
    jumpdest        ; 1 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    dup1            ; 3 gas
    mul             ; 5 gas
    swap1           ; 3 gas
    jump            ; 8 gas
```
_Total: 33 gas_

Using `RJUMPSUB` versus `JUMP` saves _33 - 17 = 16_ gas — a _48%_ improvement.

#### Efficiency Caveats

We can see that these instructions provide a simpler and more gas-efficient subroutine mechanism than using `JUMP` — in our examples they cut gas use by about half. 

Clearly, the benefits of this efficiency are greater for programs that have been factored into smaller subroutines.  How small?  A subroutine could use _90_ more gas than our first, _22_ gas example and `RJUMPSUB` would still use better than _20% less total gas_ than `JUMP`.

### Costs

The _low_ cost of `RJUMPSUB` versus the _mid_ cost of `JUMP` is justified by needing only to decode the immediate two byte destination to the `PC` and push the return address on the `return stack`, all using native arithmetric, versus using the data stack with emulated 256-bit instructions.

The _verylow_ cost of `RETURNSUB` is justified by needing only to pop the `return stack` into the `PC`.  Benchmarking will be needed to tell if the costs are well-balanced.

## Backwards Compatibility

These changes affect the semantics of existing EVM code: bytes that would have been interpreted as valid jump destinations may now be interpreted as immediate data.  Since this proposal depends on the Ethereum Object Format to signal the change this is not a practical issue.

## Test Cases

### Simple routine

This should jump into a subroutine, back out and stop.

Bytecode: `0x5f0003005e` (`RJUMPSUB 3, RETURNSUB, STOP`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |   RJUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    2  |       STOP  |    0 |        [] |        [] |
|    3  |  RETURNSUB  |    3 |        [] |        [] |

Output: 0x
Consumed gas: `10`

### Two levels of subroutines

This should execute fine, going into one two depths of subroutines

Bytecode: `0x5f00045F00025200` (`RJUMPSUB 4, RJUMPSUB 2, RETURNSUB, RETURNSUB, STOP`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |   RJUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    3  |   RJUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    4  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    5  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    6  |       STOP  |    0 |        [] |        [] |

Consumed gas: `20`

### Failure 1: invalid jump

This should fail, since the given location is outside of the code-range.

Bytecode: '0X5fff'(`RJUMPSUB -1`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |   RJUMPSUB  |   10 |        [] |        [] |

```
Error: at pc=0, op=RJUMPSUB: invalid jump destination
```

### Failure 2: shallow `return stack`

This should fail at first opcode, due to shallow `return_stack`

Bytecode: `0x5e` (`RETURNSUB`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |

```
Error: at pc=0, op=RETURNSUB: invalid retsub
```

### Subroutine at end of code

In this example the RJUMPSUB is on the last byte of code. When the subroutine returns, it should hit the 'virtual stop' _after_ the bytecode, and not exit with error

Bytecode: `0x5c035e5ff` (`RJUMP 3, RETURNSUB, RJUMPSUB -1`)

|  Pc   |      Op     | Cost |   Stack   |   RStack  |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|-----------|
|    0  |      RJUMP  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    2  |  RETURNSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    3  |   RJUMPSUB  |    5 |        [] |        [] |
|    5  |       STOP  |    0 |        [] |        [] |

Consumed gas: `15`

## Reference Implementation 

The following is a pseudo-Python implementation of an algorithm for predicating code validity.  An equivalent algorithm must be run at initialization time.  

This algorithm performs a symbolic execution of the program that recursively traverses the _code_, emulating its control flow and stack use and checking for violations of the rules above.

It runs in time equal to `O(vertices + edges)` in the program's control-flow graph, where edges represent control flow and the vertices represent _basic blocks_ — thus the algorithm takes time proportional to the size of the _code_. It uses recursion to maintain a stack of continuations for conditional jumps, the size of which is at most proportional to the size of the _code_.

### Validation Function

For simplicity's sake we assume that all jumpdest analysis and prior validation has been done, including EIP-3540, EIP-3670, and EIP-4200, so EOF headers and sections are well-formed, and there are no invalid instructions or jumps. We also also assume some helper functions.
* `immediate_data(pc)` returns the immediate data for the instruction at `pc`.
* `immediate_size(opcode)` returns the size of the immediate data for an opcode.
* `removed_items(pc,sp)` returns the number of items removed from the `data_stack` by the instruction at `pc`.
* `added_items(pc,sp)` returns the number of items added to the `data_stack` by the instruction at `pc`.

        sp -= removed_items(pc, sp)
        assert sp >= 0
        sp += added_items(pc, sp)
```

## Security Considerations

These changes introduce new flow control instructions.  They do not introduce any new security considerations. This EIP is intended to improve security by validating a higher level of safety for EVM code deployed on the blockchain.
