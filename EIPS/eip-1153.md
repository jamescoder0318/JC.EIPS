## Abstract
This proposal introduces transient storage opcodes, which manipulate state that behaves identically to storage, except that transient storage is discarded after every transaction. In other words, the values of transient storage are never deserialized from storage or serialized to storage. Thus transient storage is cheaper since it never requires disk access. Transient storage is accessible to smart contracts via 2 new opcodes, `TLOAD` and `TSTORE`, where “T” stands for "transient:"

```
TLOAD  (0xb3)
TSTORE (0xb4)
```

## Motivation
Running a transaction in Ethereum can generate multiple nested frames of execution, each created by `CALL` (or similar) instructions. Contracts can be re-entered during the same transaction, in which case there are more than one frame belonging to one contract. Currently, these frames can communicate in two ways: via inputs/outputs passed via `CALL` instructions, and via storage updates. If there is an intermediate frame belonging to another untrusted contract, communication via inputs/outputs is not secure. Notable example is a reentrancy lock which cannot rely on the intermediate frame to pass through the state of the lock. Communication via storage (`SSTORE`/`SLOAD`) is costly. Transient storage is a dedicated and gas efficient solution to the problem of inter frame communication.

Storage refunds accumulated due to inter frame communication are also limited to 20% of gas spent by a transaction due to [EIP-3529](./eip-3529.md) (introduced in the London hard fork). This greatly reduces the refunds for transiently-set storage slots in otherwise low-cost transactions. For example, in order to receive the full refund of one re-entrancy lock, the transaction must spend ~80k gas on other operations.

Language support could be added in relatively easy way. For example, in Solidity, a qualifier `transient` can be introduced (similar to the existing qualifiers `memory` and `storage`, and Java's own `transient` keyword with a similar meaning). Since the addressing scheme of `TSTORE` and `TLOAD` is the same as for `SSTORE` and `SLOAD`, code generation routines that exist for storage variables, can be easily generalised to also support transient storage.

Potential use cases enabled or improved by this EIP include:
1. Reentrancy lock
2. Constructor arguments loaded from the factory contract (for on-chain-computable CREATE2 addresses as in Uniswap V3)
3. Single transaction ERC20 approvals, e.g. `#approveAndCall(address callee, uint256 amount, bytes memory data)`
4. Passing error codes and messages from the execution frames up the execution stack
5. More generic libraries that use callbacks, for example generalised sorting with functions `Less` and `Swap` defined.
6. Contracts that require control before and after method execution (e.g. via callbacks)
7. Shared memory (borrowed from early draft of similar EIP by @holiman). When implementing contract-proxies using `DELEGATECALL`, all direct arguments are relayed from the caller to the callee via the `CALLDATA`, leaving no room for meta-data between the proxy and the proxee. Also, the proxy must be careful about `storage` access to avoid collision with `target` `storage`-slots. Since `transient storage` would be shared, it would be possible to use `transient storage` to pass information between the `proxy` and the `target`.

These opcodes are more efficient to execute than the `SSTORE` and `SLOAD` opcodes because the original value never needs to be loaded from storage (i.e. is always 0). The gas accounting rules are also simpler, since no refunds are required.

## Specification
Two new opcodes are added to EVM, `TLOAD` (`0xb3`) and `TSTORE` (`0xb4`). Note that previous drafts of this EIP specified the values `0x5c` and `0x5d` for `TLOAD` and `TSTORE` respectively, but these have been modified so as not to conflict with other draft EIPs.

They use the same arguments on stack as `SLOAD` (`0x54`) and `SSTORE` (`0x55`).

`TLOAD` pops one 32-byte word from the top of the stack, treats this value as the address, fetches 32-byte word from the transient storage at that address, and pops the value on top of the stack.

`TSTORE` pops two 32-byte words from the top of the stack. The word on the top is the address, and the next is the value. `TSTORE` saves the value at the given address in the transient storage.

Addressing is the same as `SLOAD` and `SSTORE`. i.e. each 32-byte address points to a unique 32-byte word.

Gas cost for `TSTORE` is the same as a warm `SSTORE` of a dirty slot (i.e. original value is not new value and is not current value, currently 100 gas), and gas cost of `TLOAD` is the same as a hot `SLOAD` (value has been read before, currently 100 gas). Gas cost cannot be on par with memory access due to transient storage's interactions with reverts.

All values in transient storage are discarded at the end of the transaction.

Transient storage is private to the contract that owns it, in the same way as persistent storage. Only owning contract frames may access their transient storage. And when they do, all the frames access the same transient store, in the same way as persistent storage, but unlike memory.

When transient storage is used in the context of `DELEGATECALL` or `CALLCODE`, then the owning contract of the transient storage is the contract that issued `DELEGATECALL` or `CALLCODE` instruction (the caller) as with persistent storage. When transient storage is used in the context of `CALL` or `STATICCALL`, then the owning contract of the transient storage is the contract that is the target of the `CALL` or `STATICCALL` instruction (the callee).

If a frame reverts, all writes to transient storage that took place between entry to the frame and the return are reverted, including those that took place in inner calls.  This mimics the behavior of persistent storage.

If the `TSTORE` opcode is called within the context of a `STATICCALL`, the call must revert. `TLOAD` is allowed within the context of a `STATICCALL`.

## Rationale
Another option to solve the problem of inter-frame communication is repricing the `SSTORE` and `SLOAD` opcodes to be cheaper for the transient storage use case. This has already been done as of [EIP-2200](./eip-2200.md). However, [EIP-3529](./eip-3529.md) reduced the maximum refund to only 20% of the transaction gas cost, which means the use of transient storage is severely limited.

Another approach is to keep the refund counter for transient storage separate from the refund counter for other storage uses, and remove the refund cap for transient storage. However, that approach is more complex to implement and understand. For example, the 20% refund cap must be applied to the gas used _after_ subtracting the uncapped gas refund. Otherwise, the refund amount available subject to the 20% refund cap could be increased by executing transient storage writes. Thus it is preferable to have a separate mechanism that does not interact with the refund counter. Future hard forks can remove the complex refund behavior meant to support the transient storage use case, encouraging migration to contracts that are more efficient for the Ethereum clients to execute.

Relative cons of this transient storage EIP: 
- Does not address transient usages of storage in existing contracts
- New code in the clients
- New concept for the yellow paper (more to update)

Relative pros of this transient storage EIP:
- Transient storage opcodes are considered separately in protocol upgrades and not inadvertently broken (e.g. [EIP-3529](./eip-3529.md))
- Clients do not need to load the original value
- No upfront gas cost to account for non-transient writes
- Does not change the semantics of the existing operations
- No need to clear storage slots after usage
- Simpler gas accounting rules
- Future storage designs (e.g. Verkle tree) do not need to account for transient storage refunds

## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP requires a hard fork to implement.

Since this EIP does not change semantics of any existing opcodes, it does not pose a backwards incompatibility risk for already-deployed contracts.

## Reference Implementation
Because the transient storage must behave identically to storage within the context of a single transaction with regards to revert behavior, it is necessary to be able to revert to a previous state of transient storage within a transaction. At the same time reverts are exceptional cases and loads and stores should be cheap.

A map plus an auxiliary writeahead list is one implementation:
- On entry to a call frame, a call marker is added to the list
- All writes are written to the list with the old data value
- When a call exits successfully no change is made
- On revert a search is made for the matching call marker on the list. All entries on the list are reverted and the list cleared to that marker.

## Security Considerations
`TSTORE` presents a new way to allocate memory on a node with linear cost. In other words, each TSTORE allows the developer to store 32 bytes for 100 gas, excluding any other required operations to prepare the stack. Given 30 million gas, the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated using TSTORE is:

```
30M gas * 1 TSTORE / 100 gas * 32 bytes / 1 TSTORE * 1MB / 2^20 bytes ~= 9.15MB
```

Given the same amount of gas, the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated in a single context by `MSTORE` is ~3.75MB:

```
30M gas = 3x + x^2 / 512 => x = ~123,169 32-byte words
~123,169 words * 32 bytes/word * 1MB / 2^20 bytes = 3.75MB
```

However, if you only spend 1M gas allocating memory in each context, and make calls to reset the memory expansion cost, you can allocate ~700KB per million gas, for a total of ~20MB of memory allocated:

```
1M gas = 3x + x^2 / 512 => x = ~21,872 32-byte words
30M gas * ~21,872 words / 1M gas * 32 bytes/word * 1MB / 2^20 bytes = ~20MB
```

For smart contract developers, there are no security considerations for existing contracts because they do not contain the new `TSTORE` or `TLOAD` opcodes. New contracts that do use the `TSTORE` and `TLOAD` opcodes operate under all the same assumptions as with storage. This EIP introduces no additional mental overhead for the developer. In some cases, transient storage simplifies contracts in that contract transient storage does not need to be cleared at the end of every transaction, e.g. in the ERC20 temporary approvals use case.
