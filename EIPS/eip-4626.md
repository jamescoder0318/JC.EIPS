## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokenized Vaults
representing shares of a single underlying [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token.
This standard is an extension on the ERC-20 token that provides basic functionality for depositing
and withdrawing tokens and reading balances.

## Motivation

Tokenized Vaults have a lack of standardization leading to diverse implementation details.
Some various examples include lending markets, aggregators, and intrinsically interest bearing tokens.
This makes integration difficult at the aggregator or plugin layer for protocols which need to conform to many standards, and forces each protocol to implement their own adapters which are error prone and waste development resources.

A standard for tokenized Vaults will lower the integration effort for yield-bearing vaults, while creating more consistent and robust implementation patterns.

## Specification

All ERC-4626 tokenized Vaults MUST implement ERC-20 to represent shares.
If a Vault is to be non-transferrable, it MAY revert on calls to `transfer` or `transferFrom`.
The ERC-20 operations `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `totalSupply`, etc. operate on the Vault "shares"
which represent a claim to ownership on a fraction of the Vault's underlying holdings.

All ERC-4626 tokenized Vaults MUST implement ERC-20's optional metadata extensions.
The `name` and `symbol` functions SHOULD reflect the underlying token's `name` and `symbol` in some way.
The value of `decimals` MUST mirror the underlying's value of `decimals`,
which may affect precision for computing the value of Vault shares

ERC-4626 tokenized Vaults MAY implement [EIP-2612](./eip-2612.md) to improve the UX of approving shares on various integrations.

### Definitions:
- asset: The underlying token managed by the Vault.
         Has units defined by the corresponding ERC-20 contract.
- share: The token of the Vault. Has a ratio of underlying assets
         exchanged on mint/deposit/withdraw/redeem (as defined by the Vault).
- fee: An amount of assets or shares charged to the user by the Vault. Fees can exists for
       deposits, yield, AUM, withdrawals, or anything else prescribed by the Vault.
- slippage: Any difference between advertised share price and economic realities of
            deposit to or withdrawal from the Vault, which is not accounted by fees.

### Methods

#### asset

The address of the underlying token used for the Vault for accounting, depositing, and withdrawing.

MUST be an ERC-20 token contract.

MUST _NOT_ revert.

```yaml
- name: asset
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs: []

  outputs:
  - name: assetTokenAddress
    type: address
```

#### totalAssets

Total amount of the underlying asset that is "managed" by Vault.

SHOULD include any compounding that occurs from yield.

MUST be inclusive of any fees that are charged against assets in the Vault.

MUST _NOT_ revert.

```yaml
- name: totalAssets
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs: []

  outputs:
  - name: totalManagedAssets
    type: uint256
```


#### convertToShares

The amount of shares that the Vault would exchange for the amount of assets provided, in an ideal scenario where all the conditions are met.

MUST NOT be inclusive of any fees that are charged against assets in the Vault.

MUST NOT show any variations depending on the caller.

MUST NOT reflect slippage or other on-chain conditions, when performing the actual exchange.

MUST NOT revert.

This calculation MAY NOT reflect the "per-user" price-per-share, and instead should reflect the "average-user's" price-per-share, meaning what the average user should expect to see when exchanging to and from.

```yaml
- name: convertToShares
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
  - name: assets
    type: uint256

  outputs:
  - name: shares
    type: uint256
```

#### convertToAssets

The amount of assets that the Vault would exchange for the amount of shares provided, in an ideal scenario where all the conditions are met.

MUST NOT be inclusive of any fees that are charged against assets in the Vault.

MUST NOT show any variations depending on the caller.

MUST NOT reflect slippage or other on-chain conditions, when performing the actual exchange.

MUST NOT revert.

This calculation MAY NOT reflect the "per-user" price-per-share, and instead should reflect the "average-user's" price-per-share, meaning what the average user should expect to see when exchanging to and from.

```yaml
- name: convertToAssets
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
  - name: shares
    type: uint256

  outputs:
  - name: assets
    type: uint256
```

#### maxDeposit

Maximum amount of the underlying asset that can be deposited into the Vault for the `receiver`, through a `deposit` call.

MUST return a limited value if `receiver` is subject to some deposit limit.

MUST return `2 ** 256 - 1` if there is no limit on the maximum amount of assets that may be deposited.

MUST _NOT_ revert.

```yaml
- name: maxDeposit
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
  - name: receiver
    type: address

  outputs:
  - name: maxAssets
    type: uint256
```

#### previewDeposit

Allows an on-chain or off-chain user to simulate the effects of their deposit at the current block, given current on-chain conditions.

MUST return as close to and no more than the exact amount of Vault shares that would be minted in a `deposit` call in the same transaction. I.e. `deposit` should return the same or more `shares` as `previewDeposit` if called in the same transaction.

MUST NOT account for deposit limits like those returned from maxDeposit and should always act as though the deposit would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough tokens approved, etc.

MUST be inclusive of deposit fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of deposit fees.

MUST NOT revert.

Note that any unfavorable discrepancy between `convertToShares` and `previewDeposit` SHOULD be considered slippage in share price or some other type of condition, meaning the depositor will lose assets by depositing.

```yaml
- name: previewDeposit
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
  - name: assets
    type: uint256

  outputs:
  - name: shares
    type: uint256
```

#### deposit

Mints `shares` Vault shares to `receiver` by depositing exactly `amount` of underlying tokens.

MUST emit the `Deposit` event.

MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the Vault contract before the `deposit` execution, and are accounted for during `deposit`.

MUST revert if all of `assets` cannot be deposited (due to deposit limit being reached, slippage, the user not approving enough underlying tokens to the Vault contract, etc).

Note that most implementations will require pre-approval of the Vault with the Vault's underlying `asset` token.

```yaml
- name: deposit
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
  - name: assets
    type: uint256
  - name: receiver
    type: address

  outputs:
  - name: shares
    type: uint256
```

#### maxMint

Maximum amount of the Vault shares that can be minted for the `receiver`, through a `mint` call.

MUST return a limited value if `receiver` is subject to some mint limit.

MUST return `2 ** 256 - 1` if there is no limit on the maximum amount of shares that may be minted.

MUST _NOT_ revert.

```yaml
- name: maxMint
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
  - name: receiver
    type: address

  outputs:
  - name: maxShares
    type: uint256
```

#### previewMint

Allows an on-chain or off-chain user to simulate the effects of their mint at the current block, given current on-chain conditions.

MUST NOT account for mint limits like those returned from maxMint and should always act as though the mint would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough tokens approved, etc.

MUST be inclusive of deposit fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of deposit fees.

MUST NOT revert.

Note that any unfavorable discrepancy between `convertToAssets` and `previewMint` SHOULD be considered slippage in share price or some other type of condition, meaning the depositor will lose assets by minting.


```yaml
- name: previewMint
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
  - name: shares
    type: uint256

  outputs:
  - name: assets
    type: uint256
```

#### mint

MUST emit the `Deposit` event.

MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the Vault contract before the `mint` execution, and are accounted for during `mint`.

MUST revert if all of `shares` cannot be minted (due to deposit limit being reached, slippage, the user not approving enough underlying tokens to the Vault contract, etc).

Note that most implementations will require pre-approval of the Vault with the Vault's underlying `asset` token.

```yaml
- name: mint
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
  - name: shares
    type: uint256

    type: uint256
```

#### maxWithdraw

Maximum amount of the underlying asset that can be withdrawn from the `owner` balance in the Vault, through a `withdraw` call.

  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
  - name: owner
    type: address

  outputs:
  - name: maxAssets
    type: uint256
```

#### previewWithdraw

Allows an on-chain or off-chain user to simulate the effects of their withdrawal at the current block, given current on-chain conditions.

MUST return as close to and no fewer than the exact amount of Vault shares that would be burned in a `withdraw` call in the same transaction. I.e. `withdraw` should return the same or fewer `shares` as `previewWithdraw` if called in the same transaction.

MUST NOT account for withdrawal limits like those returned from maxWithdraw and should always act as though the withdrawal would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough shares, etc.

MUST be inclusive of withdrawal fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of withdrawal fees.

MUST NOT revert.

Note that any unfavorable discrepancy between `convertToShares` and `previewWithdraw` SHOULD be considered slippage in share price or some other type of condition, meaning the depositor will lose assets by depositing.


```yaml
- name: previewWithdraw
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
  - name: assets
    type: uint256

  outputs:
  - name: shares
    type: uint256
```

#### withdraw

Burns `shares` from `owner` and sends exactly `assets` of underlying tokens to `receiver`.

MUST emit the `Withdraw` event.

MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the Vault contract before the `withdraw` execution, and are accounted for during `withdraw`.

MUST revert if all of `assets` cannot be withdrawn (due to withdrawal limit being reached, slippage, the owner not having enough shares, etc).

Note that some implementations will require pre-requesting to the Vault before a withdrawal may be performed. Those methods should be performed separately.

```yaml
- name: withdraw
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
  - name: assets
    type: uint256
  - name: receiver
    type: address

MUST NOT account for redemption limits like those returned from maxRedeem and should always act as though the redemption would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough shares, etc.

MUST be inclusive of withdrawal fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of withdrawal fees.

MUST NOT revert.

Note that any unfavorable discrepancy between `convertToAssets` and `previewRedeem` SHOULD be considered slippage in share price or some other type of condition, meaning the depositor will lose assets by redeeming.

```yaml
- name: previewRedeem
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
  - name: shares
    type: uint256

  outputs:
  - name: assets
    type: uint256
```

#### redeem

Burns exactly `shares` from `owner` and sends `assets` of underlying tokens to `receiver`.

MUST emit the `Withdraw` event.

MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the Vault contract before the `redeem` execution, and are accounted for during `redeem`.

MUST revert if all of `shares` cannot be redeemed (due to withdrawal limit being reached, slippage, the owner not having enough shares, etc).

Note that some implementations will require pre-requesting to the Vault before a withdrawal may be performed. Those methods should be performed separately.

```

### Events

#### Deposit

`caller` has exchanged `assets` for `shares`, and transferred those `shares` to `receiver`.

MUST be emitted when tokens are deposited into the Vault via the `mint` and `deposit` methods.


```yaml
- name: Deposit
  type: event

  inputs:
  - name: caller
    indexed: true
    type: address
  - name: receiver
    indexed: true
    type: address
  - name: assets
    indexed: false
    type: uint256
  - name: shares
    indexed: false
    type: uint256
```

#### Withdraw

`caller` has exchanged `shares` for `assets`, and transferred those `assets` to `receiver`.

MUST be emitted when shares are withdrawn from the Vault in `ERC4626.redeem` or `ERC4626.withdraw` methods.

```yaml
- name: Withdraw
  type: event

  inputs:
  - name: caller
    indexed: true
    type: address
  - name: receiver
    indexed: true
    type: address
  - name: assets
    indexed: false
    type: uint256
  - name: shares
    indexed: false
    type: uint256
```

## Rationale

The Vault interface is designed to be optimized for integrators with a feature complete yet minimal interface.
Details such as accounting and allocation of deposited tokens are intentionally not specified,
as Vaults are expected to be treated as black boxes on-chain and inspected off-chain before use.

ERC-20 is enforced because implementation details like token approval
and balance calculation directly carry over to the shares accounting.
This standardization makes the Vaults immediately compatible with all ERC-20 use cases in addition to ERC-4626.

The mint method was included for symmetry and feature completeness.
Most current use cases of share-based Vaults do not ascribe special meaning to the shares such that
a user would optimize for a specific number of shares (`mint`) rather than specific amount of underlying (`deposit`).
However, it is easy to imagine future Vault strategies which would have unique and independently useful share representations.

A single `assetsPerShare` method can only be guaranteed to be exact with one of the four mutable methods,
unless significant conditions are placed on the use cases that can comply with this standard.
Use cases that require to know the value of a Vault position need to know the result of a `redeem` call, without executing it.
On the other hand, integrators that intend to call `withdraw` on Vaults with the user approving only the exact amount of
underlying need the result of a `withdraw` call. Similar use cases can be found for `deposit` and `mint`.

As such, the `assetsPerShare` method has been kept for ease of integration on part of the simpler use cases,
but `preview*` methods have been included for each one of the four mutable methods.
In each case, the value of a preview method is only guaranteed to equal the return value of the related mutable method
if called immediately before in the same transaction.

The `max*` methods are used to check for deposit/withdraw limits on Vault capacity. These can be consumed off-chain for more user focused applications or on-chain for more on-chain aggregation/integration use cases.

If implementors intend to support EOA account access directly, they should consider adding an additional function with the means to accommodate slippage loss or deposit/withdrawal limits,
since their transaction will revert if the exact amount is not achieved.

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-4626 is fully backward compatible with the ERC-20 standard and has no known compatibility issues with other standards.
For production implementations of Vaults which do not use ERC-4626, wrapper adapters can be developed and used.

## Reference Implementations

See [Solmate ERC4626](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/pull/88):
a minimal and opinionated implementation of the standard with hooks for developers to easily insert custom logic into deposits and withdrawals.

See [Vyper ERC4626](https://github.com/fubuloubu/ERC4626):
a demo implementation of the standard in Vyper, with hooks for share price manipulation and other testing needs.

## Security Considerations

This specification has similar security considerations to the ERC-20 interface.

Fully permissionless use cases could fall prey to malicious implementations which only conform to the interface but not the specification.
It is recommended that all integrators review the implementation for potential ways of losing user deposits before integrating.

The methods `totalAssets`, `convertToShares` and `convertToAssets` are estimates useful for display purposes,
and do _not_ have to confer the _exact_ amount of underlying assets their context suggests.

The `preview` methods return values that are as close as possible to exact as possible. For that reason, they are manipulable by altering the on-chain conditions and are not always safe to be used as price oracles. This specification includes `convert` methods that are allowed to be inexact and therefore can be implemented as robust price oracles. For example, it would be correct to implement the `convert` methods as using a time-weighted average price in converting between assets and shares.

Integrators of ERC-4626 Vaults should be aware of the difference between these view methods when integrating with this standard.
