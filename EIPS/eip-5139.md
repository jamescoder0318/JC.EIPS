## Abstract
This proposal specifies a JSON schema for describing lists of remote procedure call (RPC) providers for Ethereum-like chains, including their supported [EIP-155](./eip-155.md) `CHAIN_ID`.

## Motivation
The recent explosion of alternate chains, scaling solutions, and other mostly Ethereum-compatible ledgers has brought with it many risks for users. It has become commonplace to blindly add new RPC providers using [EIP-3085](./eip-3085.md) without evaluating their trustworthiness. At best, these RPC providers may be accurate, but track requests; and at worst, they may provide misleading information and frontrun transactions.

If users instead are provided with a comprehensive provider list built directly by their wallet, with the option of switching to whatever list they so choose, the risk of these malicious providers is mitigated significantly, without sacrificing functionality for advanced users.

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### List Validation & Schema

List consumers (like wallets) MUST validate lists against the provided schema. List consumers MUST NOT connect to RPC providers present only in an invalid list.

Lists MUST conform to the following JSON Schema:

```json

      "properties": {

For illustrative purposes, the following is an example list following the schema:

```json
{
  "name": "Example Provider List",
  "version": {
    "major": 0,
    "minor": 1,
    "patch": 0,
    "build": "XPSr.p.I.g.l"
  },
  "timestamp": "2004-08-08T00:00:00.0Z",
  "logo": "https://mylist.invalid/logo.png",
  "providers": [
    {
      "name": "Frustrata",
      "chains": [
        {
          "chainId": 1,
          "endpoints": [
            "https://mainnet1.frustrata.invalid/",
            "https://mainnet2.frustrana.invalid/"
          ]
        },
        {
          "chainId": 3,
          "endpoints": [
            "https://ropsten.frustrana.invalid/"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Sourceri",
      "chains": [
        {
          "chainId": 1,
          "endpoints": [
            "https://mainnet.sourceri.invalid/"
          ]
        },
        {
          "chainId": 42,
          "endpoints": [
            "https://kovan.sourceri.invalid"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Versioning

List versioning MUST follow the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](../assets/eip-5139/semver.md) (SemVer) specification.

The major version MUST be incremented for the following modifications:

 - Removing a provider.
 - Removing the last `ProviderChain` for a chain id.

The major version MAY be incremented for other modifications, as permitted by SemVer.

If the major version is not incremented, the minor version MUST be incremented for the following modifications:

 - Adding a provider.
 - Adding the first `ProviderChain` of a chain id.

The minor version MAY be incremented for other modifications, as permitted by SemVer.

### Publishing

Provider lists SHOULD be published to an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) name using [EIP-1577](./eip-1577.md)'s `contenthash` mechanism on mainnet.

Provider lists MAY instead be published using HTTPS. Provider lists published in this way MUST allow reasonable access from other origins (generally by setting the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.)

## Rationale

This specification has two layers (provider, then chain id) instead of a flatter structure so that wallets can choose to query multiple independent providers for the same query and compare the results.

Each provider may specify multiple endpoints to implement load balancing or redundancy.

List version identifiers conform to SemVer to roughly communicate the kinds of changes that each new version brings. If a new version adds functionality (eg. a new chain id), then users can expect the minor version to be incremented. Similarly, if the major version is not incremented, list subscribers can assume dapps that work in the current version will continue to work in the next one.

## Security Considerations

Ultimately it is up to the end user to decide on what list to subscribe to. Most users will not change from the default list maintained by their wallet. Since wallets already have access to private keys, giving them additional control over RPC providers seems like a small increase in risk.

While list maintainers may be incentivized (possibly financially) to include or exclude particular providers, actually doing so may jeopardize the legitimacy of their lists. This standard facilitates swapping lists, so if such manipulation is revealed, users are free to swap to a new list with little effort.
