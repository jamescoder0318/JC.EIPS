## Abstract

Reverting whole transaction or some sub-call of it means ignoring any state modifications happened inside. But now users are being charged for such non-modifications as for modifications.

Since [EIP-3298](./eip-3298.md) gas refund mechanism works for storage restores only inside the same transaction. But on reverts gas refund is not being increased, it will even be completely erased - this should be changed.

It makes sense to keep access cost, but to refund modification cost.
- Reverted SSTORE deserves to be repriced to SLOAD gas (100 gas)
- Reverted LOG0, LOG1, LOG2, LOG3 and LOG4 deserve to be repriced to 100 gas
- Reverted CALL with value (`positive_value_cost` = 9,000 gas) deserves to be repriced to 100 gas
- Reverted CALL with value and account creation (`value_to_empty_account_cost` = 25,000 gas) deserves to be repriced to 100 gas
- Reverted CREATE and CREATE2 (32,000 gas) deserve to be repriced to 100 gas
- Reverted SELFDESTRUCT (5,000 or 25,000 gas) deserves to be repriced to 100 gas

Moreover it seems fair to charge CREATE and CREATE2 operations 32,000 fix price conditionally only if returned bytecode is not empty.

## Motivation

Blockhain users pay for storage non-modification as for storage modification - this seems unfair. Sometimes it's even cheaper to transfer tokens back to the user at the end of the transaction instead of reverting it too keep existing gas refund.

## Specification

Let's accumulate `call.sstores_sloads_diff_counter += (SSTORE_price - SLOAD_price)` on every `SSTORE` for every call. And let's accumulate `current_call.log_gas_counter += newEvent.gas`

```javascript
if (call.reverted) {
    // existing behavior
    tx.gas_refund -= call.gas_refund_counter;
    
    // New behavior added to existing according to EIP-3978
    tx.gas_refund += call.sstores_sloads_diff_counter;
    tx.gas_refund += (call.log_gas_counter - call.events.length * 100);
    tx.gas_refund += (call.accumulated_positive_value_cost * 89 / 90);
    tx.gas_refund += (call.accumulated_value_to_empty_account_cost * 249 / 250);
    tx.gas_refund += (call.accumulated_create_and_create2_cost * 319 / 320);
    tx.gas_refund += (call.accumulated_selfdestruct_to_existing_account_cost * 249 / 250);
    tx.gas_refund += (call.accumulated_selfdestruct_to_new_account_cost * 49 / 50);
}
```
