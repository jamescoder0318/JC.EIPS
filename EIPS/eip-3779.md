## Abstract

This EIP specifies validation rules for some important safety properties, including
* valid instructions,
* valid jump destinations,
* no stack underflows, and
* no stack overflows without recursion.

Valid contracts will not halt with an exception unless they either run out of gas, attempt to dynamically jump to an unvalidated destination, or overflow stack during a recursive subroutine call.

Code must validated at contract creation time – not runtime – by the provided algorithm or its equivalent.  Therefore, valid jump destinations for dynamic jumps are specified in an EOF container section.  This allows for a one-pass algorithm that is (and must be) linear in the size of the _code_, so as not to be a DoS vulnerability.

## Motivation

Validating safe control flow at creation time has a few important advantages.
* Jump destination analysis does not need to be performed at runtime, thus improving performance and preventing denial of service attacks.
* Jump destination validity does not always need to be checked for at runtime, improving performance.
* Stack underflow does not ever need to be checked for at runtime, improving performance.

Dynamic jumps, where the destination of a JUMP or JUMPI is not known until runtime, can be an obstacle to statically proving this sort of safety, but have also been seen as necessary to implement the return jump from a subroutine. But consider this example of calling a minimal subroutine
```
ADD:
    RTN_ADD 
    0x02
    0x03
    ADDITION
    jump
RTN_ADD:
    jumpdest
    swap1
    jump

ADDITION:
    jumpdest
    add
    swap1
    jump 
```
Note that the return address and the destination address are pushed on the stack as constants, so the `JUMP` instructions are in fact static, not dynamic – they jump to the same `PC` on every run.  We do not need (nor typically use) dynamic jumps to implement subroutines.

Since many of the jumps we need in practice are static we can validate their safety with a static analysis of the _code_.  And since can, we should.

Still, providing for the safe use of dynamic jumps makes for concise and efficient implementations of language constructs like switches and virtual functions.

Dynamic jumps can be an obstacle to linear-time validation of EVM bytecode. But even where jumps are dynamic it is possible to tabulate valid destinations in advance, and the Ethereum Object Format gives us a place to store such tables. So again, we can validate their safety with a static analysis of the code, and we should.

## Specification

### Dependencies

We need [EIP-3540: EVM Object Format (EOF)](./eip-3540.md) to support container sections.

### EOF container changes

1. A new EOF section called `jumptable` (`section_kind = 3`) is introduced. It contains a sequence of *n* tuples *(jumpsrc, jumpdest<sub>i</sub>*, sorted in ascending lexicographic order.  Each tuple represents a valid jump from one location in the bytecode to another.
2. The `jumpsrc` and `jumpdest` values are encoded as 3-byte, MSB-first, unsigned integers.

### Validity

We define safety here as avoiding exceptional halting states:
* Valid contracts will not halt with an exception unless they
   * run out of gas or
   * overflow stack while making a recursive subroutine call.

Attempts to create contracts that cannot be proven to be valid will fail.

#### Exceptional Halting States

_Execution_ is as defined in the [Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf)  a sequence of changes to the EVM state.  The conditions on valid _code_ are preserved by state changes.  At runtime, if execution of an instruction would violate a condition the execution is in an exceptional halting state.  The Yellow Paper defines five such states.
1. Insufficient gas
2. More than 1024 stack items
3. Insufficient stack items
4. Invalid jump destination
5. Invalid instruction

We would like to consider EVM _code_ valid iff no execution of the program can lead to an exceptional halting state, but we must be able to validate _code_ in linear time to avoid denial of service attacks.  So in practice, we can only partially meet these requirements.  Our validation algorithm does not consider the codes data and computations, only its control flow and stack use.  This means we will reject programs with any invalid _code_ paths, even if those paths are not reachable at runtime.   Further, conditions _1_ and _2_  Insufficient gas and stack overflow  must in general be checked at runtime.  Conditions _3_, _4_, and _5_ cannot occur if the _code_ conforms to the following rules.

#### The Rules

> This section extends the contact creation validation rules (as defined in EIP-3540.)
0. All instructions are valid.
1. Every JUMP and JUMPI address either
   * a constant, a valid JUMPDEST or
   * a matching tuple in the jumptable.
    The stack depth at the end of a basic block is always always positive.
2. The stack depth is
   * always positive and
   * the same on every path through a bytecode.
3. The `stack pointer` is always positive and at most 1024.

We need to define `matching tuple`.  A tuple matches a `jmpsrc` to a `jumpdest` if the first element of the tuple is the offset of a `JUMP` or `JUMPI` opcode in the bytecode, and the second element is the address of a `JUMPDEST` opcode in the bytecode.

We need to define `stack depth`.  The Yellow Paper has the `stack pointer` (`SP`) pointing just past the top item on the `data stack`.   We define the `stack base` as the element that the `SP` addressed at the entry to the current _basic block_, or `0` on program entry.  So we can define the `stack depth` as the number of stack elements between the current `SP` and the current `stack base`.

#### An Algorithm 

> This section specifies an algorithm for checking the above the rules.  Equivalent code must be run at creation time (as defined in EIP-3540.)

The following is a pseudo-Go implementation of an algorithm for enforcing program validity.  This algorithm is a symbolic execution of the program that recursively traverses the bytecode, following its control flow and stack use and checking for violations of the rules above.   It uses a stack to track the slots that hold `PUSHed` constants, from which it pops the destinations to validate during the analysis.

This algorithm runs in time equal to `O(vertices + edges)` in the program's control-flow graph, where vertices represent control-flow instructions and the edges represent basic blocks – thus the algorithm takes time proportional to the size of the bytecode.

For simplicity's sake we assume a few helper functions.
* `advance_pc()` advances the `PC`,  skipping any immediate data.
* `imm_data()` returns immediate data for an instruction.
* valid_jumpdest() tests whether
   * dynamic jumps match a valid (jumpsrc, jumpdest) in the jumptable and
   * all jump destinations are JUMPDEST bytes and not in immediate data.
* `add_items()` and `remove_items()` push or pop the `const_stack` items for an instruction,
    and return its effect on the `stack pointer`.
    `add_items()` will `PUSH` the value of constants – all other stack items are zeroed.
```
var bytecode [code_len]byte
var stack_depth [code_len]unsigned
var const_stack [1024]unsigned
var SP := 0
var BP := 0
struct { int src; int dst } jumps
var jumptable [n_jumps]jumps

func validate(PC :=0, stack_depth:=0) boolean {

	for ; PC < code_len; PC = advance_pc(PC, instruction) {

		// valid instructions only
		instruction := bytecode[PC]
		if !valid_instruction(instruction) {
			return false;
		}

		// if stack depth for `PC` is non-zero we have been here before 
		// so return to break cycle in control flow graph
		if stack_depth[PC] != 0 {
			if stack_depth[PC] == stack_depth
				return true
			else
				return false
		}
		stack_depth[PC] = stack_depth

		if instruction == JUMP {

			// check for valid destination
			dest = const_stack[SP]
			if !valid_jumpdest(dest) {
			   return false
			}

			// reset PC to destination of jump 
			PC += jumpdest
			BP = SP
			--SP
			continue
		}
		if instruction == JUMPI {

			// check for valid destination
			jumpdest = stack[SP]
			 if !valid_jumpdest(dest) {
				return false
			}
			
			// false side of if
			if stack[SP - 1] == 0 {
				BP = SP
				continue
			}


			// check for stack underflow and
			// reset PC to destination of jump 
			stack_depth := SP - entry_SP
			if stack_depth < 0 { 
				return false
			}
			BP = SP
			--SP
			PC = jumpdest

			// recurse to jump to code to validate
			if !validate(PC), stack_depth {
				return false
			}
			continue 
		}

		// check effect of instruction on stack
		SP -= remove_items(instruction)
		SP += add_items(instruction)
		if SP < 0 || 1024 < SP {
			return false
		}

		// successful validation of path
		if PC > code_len
			   || instruction == STOP
			   || instruction == RETURN
			   || instruction == SUICIDE {
			return true
		}
	}
}
```

## Rationale

The alternative to checking validity at creation time is checking it at runtime.  This hurts performance and is a denial of service vulnerability.  Thus the above rules and accompanying one-pass validation algorithm.

_Rule 1_ – requiring static or previously tabulated destinations for `JUMP` and `JUMPI` – simplifies static jumps and constrains dynamic jumps.
* Jump destinations are currently checked at runtime, but static jumps can be validated at creation time. 
*  Requiring the possible destinations of dynamic jumps to be tabulated in advance allows for tractable bytecode traversal for creation-time validation: a  jump table takes up space proportional to the number of jump destinations, so attempting to attack the validation algorithm with large numbers of jump destinations will also reduce the available space for _code_ to be validated.

_Rule 2_ – requiring positive, constant stack depth  – ensures sufficient stack.  Exceptions can be caused by irreducible paths like jumping into loops and subroutines, and by calling subroutines with insufficient numbers of arguments.

_Rule 3_ – bounding the `stack pointer` – catches all stack overflows that occur without recursion.

Taken together, these rules allow for code to be validated by traversing the control-flow graph, following each edge only once.

## Backwards Compatibility

These changes affect the semantics of existing EVM code – the use of JUMP, JUMPI, and the stack are restricted, such that some existing _code_ that run correctly will nonetheless become invalid EOF _code_ sections. 

## Security Considerations

This EIP is intended to ensure a minimal level of safety for EVM code deployed on the blockchain.
