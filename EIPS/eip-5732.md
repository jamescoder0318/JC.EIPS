## Abstract

A simple commit interface to support commit-reveal scheme which provides **only** a commit
method but no reveal method, allowing implementations to integrate this interface
with arbitrary reveal method such as `vote` or `transfer`.

## Motivation

1. support commit-reveal privacy for applications such as voting.
2. make it harder for attackers for front-running, back-running or sandwich attack.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1. Compliant contract MUST to implement the `IERC_COMMIT_CORE` interface

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

/// The EIP-165 identifier of this interface is 0xf14fcbc8
interface IERC_COMMIT_CORE {
    function commit(bytes32 _commitment) payable external;
}
```

2. Compliant contract is RECOMMENDED to implement `IERC_COMMIT_GENERAL` interface.

When implementing the method of `commitFrom` in addition to the `commit` method, the `commit(_commitment)` MUST be equivalent as if called `commitFrom(msg.sender, _commitment, [/*empty arraye*/]);`. The `returns(uint256)` is RECOMMENDED to return either `block.timestamp` or `block.number` or a number that indicate the ordering of different commitments. When `commitFrom` is being called.

3. If compliant contract implements `IERC_COMMIT_GENERAL`, the event `Commit` MUST be emitted when a commitment is accepted and recorded. In the parameter of both `Commit` and the `commitFrom` method, the `_timePoint` is a time-point-representing value that represents ordering of commitments in which a latter commitment will always have a greater value than a former commitment, such as `block.timestamp` or `block.number` or other time scale chosen by implementing contracts. The `extraData` is reserved for future behavior extension. If the `_from` is different from the TX signer, it is RECOMMENDED that compliant contract SHOULD validate signature for `_from`. For EOAs this will be validating its ECDSA signatures on chain. For smart contract accounts, it is RECOMMENDED to use [EIP-1271](./eip-1271.md) to validate the signatures.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

/// The EIP-165 identifier of this interface is 0x67b2ec2c
interface IERC_COMMIT_GENERAL {
    event Commit(
        uint256 indexed _timePoint,
        address indexed _from,
        bytes32 indexed _commitment,
        bytes _extraData);
    function commitFrom(
        address _from,
        bytes32 _commitment,
        bytes calldata _extraData)
    payable external returns(uint256 /*timePoint*/);
}
```

4. One or more methods of a compliant contract MAY be used for reveal.

But there MUST be a way to supply an extra field of `secret_salt`, so that committer can later open the `secret_salt` in the reveal TX that exposes the `secret_salt`. The size and location of `secret_salt` is intentionally unspecified in this EIP to maximize flexibility for integration.

5. Compliant contract is RECOMMENDED to implement [EIP-165](./eip-165.md).

## Rationale

1. One design options is that we can attach a Commit Interface to any individual ERCs such as voting standards or token standards. We choose to have a simple and  eneralize commit interface so all ERCs can be extended to support commit-reveal without changing their basic method signatures.

2. The key derived design decision we made is we will have  a standardized `commit` method without a standardized `reveal` method, making room for customized reveal method or using `commit` with existing standard.

3. We chose to have a simple one parameter method of `commit` in our Core interface to make it fully backward compatible with a few prior-adoptions e.g. ENS

4. We also add a `commitFrom` to easy commitment being generated off-chain and submitted by some account on behalf by another account.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is backward compatible with all existing ERCs method signature that has extraData. New EIPs can be designed with an extra field of "salt" to make it easier to support this EIP, but not required.

The `IERC_COMMIT_CORE` is backward compatible with ENS implementations and other existing prior-art.

## Reference Implementation

### Commit with Token-Transfer as Reveal

Example of a Simple Transfer Standard being integrated with this EIP:

```solidity
interface ISimpleToken {
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount);
}

contract SomeToken is ISimpleToken {
    mapping(address => uint256, bytes calldata extraData) balance;
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata extraData) {
        required(balance[msg.sender] > amount);
        balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balance[to] += amount;
    }
}
```

When integrating with this EIP, it becomes this

```solidity
interface ISimpleToken {
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata extraData);
}

contract SomeBetterToken is ISimpleToken, IERC_COMMIT_CORE {
    mapping(address => uint256) balance;
    mapping(address => bytes32) lastCommits;
    function commit(bytes32 _commitment) {
        lastCommits[msg.sender] = _commitment;
        emit Commit(...);
    }
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount, bytes calldata _extraData/*first 32bytes are used as secret_sault*/) {
        required(balance[msg.sender] > amount);
        // pseudo code.
        require(lastCommits[msg.sender] == _recomputeCommit(msg.sender, _to, _amount, _extraData[:32])); // the commitment from last sender was
        delete lastCommits[msg.sender]; // immediately delete commits to avoid reentry attack.
        balance[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balance[to] += amount;
    }

    function _recomputeCommit(address _sender, address _to, uint256 _amount, bytes32 _secretSalt) returns (bytes32){
        return keccak256(abi.encodePack(_sender, _to, _amount, _secretSalt));
    }

}
```

### Commit with Voting as Reveal

Example of a Simple Transfer Standard being integrated with this EIP:

```solidity
interface ISimpleToken {
    function vote(address _proposalId, uint8 _optionId, bytes calldata _extraData);
}

contract FooVote is ISimpleToken {
    mapping(address => uint256/*proposalId*/ => uint8/*optionId*/) ballots;
    function vote(address _proposalId, uint8 _optionId, bytes calldata _extraData) {
        ballots[msg.sender][_proposalId] = _optionId;
    }

    // Ballot tally method omitted.
}
```

When integrating with this EIP, it becomes this

```solidity
interface ISimpleVote {
    function vote(uint256 _proposalId);
}

contract BarVote is ISimpleVote, IERC_COMMIT_CORE {
    mapping(address => address => bool) proposalVotes;
    mapping(address => bytes32) lastCommits;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) proposalDeadlines; // block number of deadline for each proposal

    function commit(bytes32 _commitment) {
        lastCommits[msg.sender] = _commitment;
        emit Commit(...);
    }

    function vote(address _proposalId, uint8 _optionId, bytes calldata _extraData) {
        // pseudo code.
        require(lastCommits[msg.sender] == _recomputeCommit(msg.sender, _proposalId, _optionId, _extraData[:32])); // the commitment from last sender was
        delete lastCommits[msg.sender]; // immediately delete commits to avoid reentry attack.
         ballots[msg.sender][_proposalId] = _optionId;
    }

    function _recomputeCommit(address _sender, address _proposalId, uint8 _optionId, bytes32 _secretSalt) returns (bytes32){
        return keccak256(abi.encodePack(_sender, _proposalId, _optionId, _secretSalt));
    }

    // Ballot tally method omitted.
    // Proposal deadline method omitted.
}
```

### Commit with ENS Register as Reveal

In ENS registering process, currently inside of `ETHRegistrarController` contract a commit function is being used to allow registerer fairly register a desire domain to avoid being front-run.

Here is how ENS uses commitment in its registration logic:

```solidity
function commit(bytes32 commitment) public {
    require(commitments[commitment] + maxCommitmentAge < now);
    commitments[commitment] = now;
}
```

With this EIP it can be updated to

```solidity
function commit(bytes32 commitment, bytes calldata data) public {
    require(commitments[commitment] + maxCommitmentAge < now);
    commitments[commitment] = now;
    emit Commit(...)；
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. Do not use the reference implementation in production. It is just for demonstration purposes.
2. The reveal transactions, parameters, especially `secret_salt` MUST be kept in secrecy before revealing to achieve privacy.
3. The length of `secret_salt` cryptographically long enough and the way to generate a `secret_salt` shall be cryptographically safe.
4. User shall NEVER reuse a used `secret_salt`. It's RECOMMENDED for client application to warn User for reusing a secret_salt.
5. Contract implementations SHOULD consider deleting the commitment of a given sender immediately to reduce chance of replay attack or re-entry attack by adversaries.
6. Contract implementations MAY consider also include the ordering of commitment received to add restriction on the order of reveal TX transactions.
7. Cautious on the potential replay attack across different chain-ids or chains resulting from forks, in which case, a ChainId shall be included in the generation of commitment.
8. Proper time-gap is suggested if the purpose is to avoid front-running attack.
