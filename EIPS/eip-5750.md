## Abstract

This EIP recognizes _any methods_ with the last parameter being a dynamically sized `bytes` to be extendible by designating their last method parameter of dynamic sized bytes to be used behavior extensions.

## Motivation

The general purpose of having extra data in a method is to allow further extensions for a existing method interface.

### Why is it useful to make method extendable

1. Any methods complying with this EIP, such as overloaded `transfer` and `vote` could use string reasons as the extra data.
2. Existing EIPs that have exported methods compliant with this EIP can be extended for behaviors such as using the extra data to prove endorsement or as a salt, nonce, or commitments for reveal/commit schemes.
3. Data can be passed forward to callbacks.

### Why there needs to be a standard for these use case

First of all, there are multiple ways to achieve extensibility for existing functions.

1. _Add a new method_, then these questions need to be answered:

- what will be the method name?
- what will be the full list of parameters?
- How many use-case do a given method name support?
- Do/Will they support off-chain signatures?

2. _Use an existing parameter(s)_: then these questions need to be answered:

- will it be one parameter?
- w- will it be multiple parameters?
- what are their sizes and types?

Standardizing how method will be extended helps answer this questions.

In particular, this EIP aims at achieving maximum backward (e.g. [EIP-721](./eip-721.md), [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md)) and future compatibility e.g. supporting commit-reveal feature for arbitrary method ([EIP-5732](./eip-5732.md)), or adding digital signatures alongside with a method call. The goal and motivation is to allow other implementers and EIPs to further depend on the compatibility based on the specifications this EIP so all compliant method interface automatically becomes eligible for future new behaviors.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1. Any compliant contract's compliant method MUST have a `bytes` (dynamic size) as its last parameter of the method.

```solidity
function methodName(type1 param1, type2, param2 ... bytes calldata data);
```

## Rationale

1. Having using the dynamically-sized `bytes` type allow for maximum flexibility to enable additional payloads of arbitrary types
2. Having the bytes specified as the last parameter makes this EIP compatible with the calldata layout of solidity.

## Backwards Compatibility

Many of existing EIPs already have compliant methods and all contracts compliant with those EIPs are already compliant with this EIP.

Here is an incomplete list:

1. In [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) the following methods are already compliant:

- `function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data) external payable;` is already compliant

2. In [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md) the following methods are already compliant

- `function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data) external;`
- `function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] calldata _ids, uint256[] calldata _values, bytes calldata _data) external;`

3. In [EIP-777](./eip-777.md) the following methods are already compliant

- `function burn(uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;`
- `function send(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;`

4. In [EIP-2535](./eip-2535.md) the following methods are already compliant

```solidity
function diamondCut(
        FacetCut[] calldata _diamondCut,
        address _init,
        bytes calldata _calldata
    ) external;
```

5. In [EIP-1271](./eip-1271.md) the following methods are already compliant:

```solidity
  function isValidSignature(
    bytes32 _hash,
    bytes memory _signature)
    public
    view
    returns (bytes4 magicValue);
```

## Security Considerations

1. If using the extra data for extended behavior, such as supplying signature for onchain verification, or supplying commitments in a commit-reveal scheme, best practices should be followed for those particular extended behaviors.
2. Compliant contracts must also take into consideration that the data parameter will be publicly revealed when submitted into the mempool or included in a block, so one must consider the risk of replay, and transaction ordering attacks. In addition, unencrypted personally identifiable information should never be included in the data parameter.
