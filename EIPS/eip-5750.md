## Abstract

This EIP standardizes the passing of unstructured call data to functions to enable future extensibility.

## Motivation

The purpose of having extra data in a method is to allow further extensions to existing method interfaces.

It is it useful to make methods extendable. Any methods complying with this EIP, such as overloaded `transfer` and `vote` could use string reasons as the extra data. Existing EIPs that have exported methods compliant with this EIP can be extended for behaviors such as using the extra data to prove endorsement, as a salt, as a nonce, or as a commitment for a reveal/commit scheme. Finally, data can be passed forward to callbacks.

There are two ways to achieve extensibility for existing functions. Each comes with their set of challenges:

1. Add a new method

  * What will the method name be?
  * What will the parameters be?
  * How many use-cases does a given method signature support?
  * Does this support off-chain signatures?

2. Use one or more existing parameters, or add one or more new ones

  * Should existing parameters be repurposed, or should more be added?
  * How many parameters should be used?
  * What are their sizes and types?

Standardizing how methods can be extended helps to answer these questions.

Finally, this EIP aims to achievie maximum backward and future compatibility. Many EIPs already partially support this EIP, such as [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) and [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md). This EIP supports many use cases, from commit-reveal schemes ([EIP-5732](./eip-5732.md)), to adding digital signatures alongside with a method call. Other implementers and EIPs should be able to depend on the compatibility granted by this EIP so that all compliant method interfaces are eligible for future new behaviors.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

`bytes` MUST refer to the dynamically-sized solidity type.

A method MUST be compliant if and only if for all of its overloads:

* The overload's call signature has a `bytes as the last parameter, and that parameter that is not used for any functionality; or
* There is another overload with the same call signature of this overload **EXCEPT** that it has a `bytes` as the last parameter, and that parameter is not used for any functionality.

```solidity
// `methodName1` is compliant: the first overload has a similar overload (the second overload) with the bytes parameter, and the second overload has the bytes parameter
function methodName1(uint256 param1, address param2);
function methodName1(uint256 param1, address param2, bytes calldata data);
// `methodName2` is compliant: its only overload has the bytes parameter
function methodName2(address param1, address param2, bytes calldata data);
// `methodName3` is not compliant: it has an overload (the third one) that doesn't have a valid overload
function methodName3(string calldata param1, bytes32 param2);
function methodName3(string calldata param1, bytes32 param2, bytes calldata data);
function methodName3(string calldata param3, address param4);
```

For the purposes of calculating [EIP-165](./eip-165.md) interface identifiers, the overloads created for the purpose of compliance with this EIP MUST be considered. 

All fully compliant contracts MUST consist only of compliant methods. All partially compliant contracts MUST consist of at least one compliant method.

## Rationale

1. Using the dynamically-sized `bytes` type allows for maximum flexibility by enabling payloads of arbitrary types.
2. Having the bytes specified as the last parameter makes this EIP compatible with the calldata layout of solidity.
3. Requiring EIP-165 interface identifiers to include the overloads does not break backward compatibility.

## Backwards Compatibility

Many existing EIPs already have compliant methods as part of their specification. All contracts compliant with those EIPs are either fully or partially compliant with this EIP.

Here is an incomplete list:

* In [EIP-721](./eip-721.md), the following method is already compliant:
  * `function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data) external payable;` is already compliant
* In [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md), the following methods are already compliant
  * `function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data) external;`
  * `function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] calldata _ids, uint256[] calldata _values, bytes calldata _data) external;`
* In [EIP-777](./eip-777.md), the following methods are already compliant
  * `function burn(uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;`
  * `function send(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;`

However, not all functions that have a `bytes` as the last parameter are compliant. The following functions are not compliant without an overload since their last parameter is involved in functionality:

* In [EIP-2535](./eip-2535.md), the following methods is not compliant:
  * `function diamondCut(FacetCut[] calldata _diamondCut, address _init, bytes calldata _calldata) external;`
  * An overload would need to be created: `function diamondCut(FacetCut[] calldata _diamondCut, address _init, bytes calldata _calldata, bytes calldata _data) external;`
* In [EIP-1271](./eip-1271.md), the following method is not compliant:
  * `function isValidSignature(bytes32 _hash, bytes memory _signature) public view returns (bytes4 magicValue);`
  * An overload would need to be created: `function isValidSignature(bytes32 _hash, bytes memory _signature, bytes calldata _data) public view returns (bytes4 magicValue);`

## Security Considerations

1. If using the extra data for extended behavior, such as supplying signature for onchain verification, or supplying commitments in a commit-reveal scheme, best practices should be followed for those particular extended behaviors.
2. Compliant contracts must also take into consideration that the data parameter will be publicly revealed when submitted into the mempool or included in a block, so one must consider the risk of replay and transaction ordering attacks. **Unencrypted personally identifiable information must never be included in the data parameter.**
