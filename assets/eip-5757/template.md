## Abstract
This proposal presents <origin name> as a permissible external origin for EIPs. Permissible origins must satisfy requirements for identification, availability, and access. This origin meets all of the requirements.

## Motivation
<!-- In this section, describe why this origin is useful to EIPs and how it meets the requirements set out in EIP-5757. -->

<origin name> should be an allowed origin of external resources because <couple sentences describing why this origin should be allowed and why it's necessary>.

### Redistribution
<!-- In this subsection, describe why you can't put resources from this origin in `assets`. Include links to incompatible licenses if applicable. -->

It is impractical to redistribute resources from <origin name> because <couple sentences describing why>.

### Identification
<!-- In this subsection, describe how this origin meets the identification requirement. If the content described by an identifier is mutable, describe how/when those changes can be made. -->

Each version of a resource <choose one: made available / cataloged> by <origin name> are uniquely identified by <description of how versions are identified>.

### Availability
<!-- In this subsection, convince the reader that the content provided by the origin will be around as long as Ethereum will be. -->

<!-- For availability based on history: -->
Since <year>, <origin name> has made its resources available with minimal interruption, and should continue to do so indefinitely.

<!-- It's also possible for a origin to guarantee availability with some technical solution (maybe posting to a blockchain). If that's the case for your origin, explain that instead of using the above. -->

## Specification
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Link Format
<!-- In this subsection, describe how to write links to resources published/cataloged by this origin. Links should always point to the most stable version. -->

```markdown
<...>
```

### Link Example
<!-- In this subsection, show a rendered example of a link as described above. -->

## Rationale
<!-- Explain any decisions made within this proposal in this section. Particularly, if there are multiple options for URL/identifiers, explain why you picked the one you did. -->
